# ConceptGrades

These brief functions let me apply concept-based grading to a CSV of student scores.

Concept-based grading assesses students on their mastery of concepts. 
These concepts can be spelled out in the syllabus, and then tested by whatever method is desired. 
To test for mastery of a concept, I typically have students take multiple tests on each concept. 
For each concept, I give students a grade of 0 to 4. 
Only when students have earned a perfect score of 4 twice are they considered to have mastered the concept. 

To assign a percentage grade for concepts, I average together the score on all concepts, and then divide by 
the max grade (5 in my setup) to get a percentage grade.
